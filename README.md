# Waste-Classification-using-CNN
Waste is an important issue that needs to be addressed in order to achieve Sustainable Development Goals No. 12 of Responsible Consumption and Production and No. 11 of Sustainable Cities. By leveraging the power of machine learning and image analysis techniques, we can revolutionize waste classification processes, leading to more efficient and effective waste management systems. The model designed has the potential to significantly reduce the burden on manual sorting and increase the overall productivity of waste management operations. Furthermore, the adoption of pattern recognition and CNN for waste classification aligns with the growing trend towards smart cities and sustainable development.
